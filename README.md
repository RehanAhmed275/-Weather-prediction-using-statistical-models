#Weather Prediction Using Statistical Models

Overview
This project aims to predict weather conditions using statistical models and machine learning techniques. Leveraging historical weather data, the project focuses on developing accurate forecasting models to predict temperature, wind speed, humidity, and other meteorological parameters.

Features
Data collection and preprocessing: Scraping weather data from online sources and cleaning the dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing trends, patterns, and correlations in the weather data.
Model development: Implementing statistical models such as ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) for time series forecasting.
Model evaluation: Assessing the performance of the models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Ensemble modeling: Combining predictions from multiple models to improve forecasting accuracy.
Visualization: Visualizing the predicted weather data and comparing it with the actual observations.

Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for data preprocessing, analysis, and model implementation.
Pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib and Plotly: Libraries for data visualization.
Statsmodels and scikit-learn: Libraries for statistical modeling and machine learning.
Dataset
The project utilizes a publicly available weather dataset containing historical weather observations such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure.

Future Work
Implementing advanced machine learning techniques such as neural networks for weather forecasting.
Incorporating additional features such as geographical factors, seasonal patterns, and climate indices for improved prediction accuracy.
Developing a web application or API for real-time weather prediction and visualization.
Exploring ensemble learning techniques to further enhance the accuracy and robustness of the forecasting models.
